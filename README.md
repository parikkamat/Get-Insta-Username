# Get-Insta-Username

When we have N-insta urls but we want to extract the username from the Instagram link then what you have to do

# Working

First method:

Clone it and change the path to your system path where your insta and username-insta located.

Second Method:

Run it in Google Collab and just use the other insta text file rather then mine.
